# Files and Their Purposes

------------

## hbt.org

This file is used for the daily, weekly, and monthly habits.

## daily.org

This is my to-do list. Every night before going to bed I will create the to-do list for the next day. This is based off of what is found in hbt.org, prj.org, and work.org. There is a master to-do list in this file that I will also reference when creating the next day's to-do list.

## prj.org

This file keeps track of all my tasks for all the different projects I have.

## work.org

This file keeps track of all my tasks for the different projects at work.
